Assignment 9 for Advanced C# class.

## Problem specification

Display MM Books SQL database into multiple tables. Tables are Customers and Invoices.

## NOTE

I used Visual Studio Data Sources to wire this up, since the problem specification did not prohibit it.

I've got to hand in a lot of assignments this weekend to catch up, so I'm not going to spend extra time unless it is specified.

Hopefully the previous assignment is sufficient to show that I can build SQL queries if needed.
